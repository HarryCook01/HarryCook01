      I am a young and enthusiastic individual with a strong interest in web development based in Suffolk,UK.
      
      I have a working knowledge of HTML,CSS and javascript that I am hoping to work on my front-end development
      and include other technologies to become a well rounded developer.
      I am looking to expand my skills and learn more Back-end technologies as well, I have used MySQL,PHP and REACT  
      
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning REACT**

      I am always continuing to learn more about HTML , CSS and Javascript as well as always wanting to learn 
      and try my hand at new things
